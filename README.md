# Getting Started

## To install dependencies:
* ```$ npm run setup```
    * **NOTE:** Do not simply run ```$ npm install ```. You must use the above command to run the custom setup script 

## To run the app:
* ```$ npm start```
    * This will launch the create-react-app dev server on port :3000.
    * **NOTE:** A second, backend Node server will run in the background on port :3001.
